This repo contains all the stuff for this react-native productivity/time-management app

The main goal of this project was to learn how to build the same application with cross platform support, including a web based UI, native apps for mobile and possibly Windows/MacOS/Linux by using react native. The focus being on how to share as much of the codebase betweenn the native and web app.

While the main focus of the project is to learn the concepts mentioned above it is also useful for me personally as I will be able to easiely customise everyday productivity tools to my liking while also bringing everything in one place...that hopefully can run without internet, which is super useful when you are in the north of Quebec with internet that can't even pass a speed test due to latency errors.

Additionaly I want to work on new technologies. Improve in React, learn Tailwind, learn React native. If this project comes to a point where it needs a backend I will probably use a microservice architecture, and try to fit in some Rust or Go if the usecase allows it.

This is more of a note to myself. Don't get a domain until you would personally use this thing...

And if it does get to that point maybe look into how to deplay a CI/CD pipeline, running everything in dockerized containers and maybe even get to play around with Kubernetes... but at that point this is whishful thinking

Here is a list of things that I want to implement


Pomodoro
Todo List (being closely integrated with the Pomodoro timer)
Calendar integration with Google (and others bcs privacy...)
Journaling/notes 
Time tracker, standalone and with the ability to use the Pomodoro timer/Calendar
App and website blocker... This would probably mean having an extension and a bunch of stuff that I might not be able to do with a React native app when it comes to app blocking but we will see when we get there
For the TODOs a Trello like board (Github integration to track issue??)

And I think that with this I have enought stuff for more than a YEAR so I will stop here.
