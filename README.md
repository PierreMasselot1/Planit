# Planit

The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with the development of a cross-platform application, using React-native and Electron. The first goal is to get most of the features working in a regular web application. Once satisfied with the development state I will try to set up a CI/CD pipeline and host the said website. Having the website hosted will also push me to handle DB migrations properly which is something that I want to be able to do properly (even if the app won't have any users at that time and resetting everything would be the easiest solution).

Current features that I am trying to implement before hosting the website and getting the mobile applications up to speed, order corresponds to priority ( and will probably change):

- [X] Pomodoro

- [ ] TODO List
- [X] User account and auth

- [ ] TODO integration with Pomodoro
- [ ] Time tracking
- [ ] Time tracking integration with Pomodoro
- [ ] Have a task board

Once those features are implemented, and the hosting and native app side of things is done I will potentially move on to the following features:

- [ ] Journaling
- [ ] Notes
- [ ] App and website blocker (Extension required?)
- [ ] ...
